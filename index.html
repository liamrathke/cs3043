Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?”.</p>

                <p>Holograms in Star Wars are used to display information or receive media such as a video call. They appear to communicate at faster than light speed, since there is no lag when holoconfrencing with someone in another system. News and other programming is sent over the Empire-controlled Holonet, which seems more like a TV channel than our internet. Holograms can be traced back to their source with the right technology.</p>

Scomp links are a universal device used to interface with a computer, similarly to how we have ports like Ethernet or USB to connect a variety of devices. Prosthetic limbs would seemingly require an onboard computer to function, but it is not specified whether or not they do. Additionally, the speeders shown in this film may have computers on board regulating things such as their height and speed, but this is not stated specifically.</p>

                      <li>Digital Divide: some sentient droids are able to choose whom they work for (e.g. bounty hunter droids)</li>
                      <li>As opposed to current technology, sentience results in droids that can discriminate when providing services; while there are differences in access to technology on Earth, once such technology is acquired, it simply "works" for its owner</li>
